# COP2800 - Java Coursework

This repository contains projects and assignments completed for the COP2800 Java Programming course at Hillsborough Community College. These exercises were designed to build a strong foundation in Java programming, covering both procedural and object-oriented paradigms.

## Course Overview

The COP2800 course focused on core Java programming principles, including:

*   Data types, variables, and operators
*   Control flow (selection statements and loops)
*   Methods and modular program design
*   Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, objects, encapsulation, constructors, getters/setters, `toString()`
*   Arrays and basic data manipulation techniques
*   User input handling (e.g., using the `Scanner` class)
*   Exception handling fundamentals
*   File I/O operations (conceptual, specific examples may vary)

The projects in this repository demonstrate the practical application of these concepts.

## Key Projects Highlighted

Below are a couple of representative projects from this coursework:

1.  **Interactive Fan Simulator**
    *   **Location:** `Module 8/Exercise 9.8/Interactive/`
    *   **Description:** A console-based Java application that simulates a customizable fan. Users can define the fan's speed (SLOW, MEDIUM, FAST), radius, color, and on/off state through interactive prompts. The program then displays the fan's final configured properties.
    *   **Concepts Demonstrated:** Object-Oriented Programming (class definition for `IFan` with fields, constants, constructor, getters, setters, and `toString()` method), object instantiation and interaction, handling various types of user input using the `Scanner` class, and basic console I/O.

2.  **Eliminate Duplicates from Array**
    *   **Location:** `Module 7/Exercise 7.15/`
    *   **Description:** This program takes an array of ten integers entered by the user and outputs only the distinct numbers (i.e., it removes any duplicate entries).
    *   **Concepts Demonstrated:** Array manipulation (creation, traversal, populating from user input), algorithm implementation for identifying and filtering unique elements, use of helper methods (static `eliminateDuplicates` method), and console input/output.

*(Other modules and exercises in this repository cover a range of foundational Java concepts.)*

## How to Use

Each project or exercise is typically self-contained within its respective folder. To compile and run most of these console-based Java applications:

1.  Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (e.g., JDK 11 or a compatible version).
2.  Navigate to the specific exercise directory (e.g., `Module 8/Exercise 9.8/Interactive/`).
3.  Compile the Java source files: `javac *.java` (or `javac SpecificFile.java MainFile.java`).
4.  Run the compiled main class: `java MainClassName` (e.g., `java TestIFan` or `java EliminateDuplicates`).

This coursework was crucial in developing my core Java programming abilities and problem-solving skills.
